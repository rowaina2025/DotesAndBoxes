# Dotes And Boxes
Dots and Boxes is an old game for one or two players. Starting with an empty grid of dots, two players take turns adding a single horizontal or vertical line between two unjoined adjacent dots. The player who completes the fourth side of a 1x1 box (or groups of one or more adjacent boxes) earns one point (s) and takes another turn.
